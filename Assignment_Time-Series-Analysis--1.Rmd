# Introduction
Colonial waterbirds have been monitored in South Florida for more than 100 years (Frederick and Ogden 2003).The first systematic surveys estimated 180,000-245,000 wading birds nested in the central and southern Everglades in the 1930â€™s (Ogden 1994). Surveys today count roughly 40,000 nests on average (Cook and Baranski 2019). There has also been a spatial shift in breeding grounds away from the coasts towards freshwater wetlands inland due to habitat degradation (Ogden 1994). Because the ecology of these birds has changed so much in response to habitat modification, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan aims to not only increase the number of nesting pairs of waterbirds, but also to restore the proportion of birds nesting in coastal colonies to 50% (Cook and Baranski 2019). Colonial waterbirds can be especially useful indicators in marine coastal regions because they provide an above-water signal for underwater ecosystem phenomena; they are often colonial allowing for a small number of highly-visible survey targets; they are mobile and respond to environmental changes with their movements; and they often reside high in the ecosystem food-web, requiring abundant, healthy prey resources to thrive (Piatt et al. 2007, Ogden et al. 2014).

In 2009, the South Florida/Caribbean Inventory and Monitoring Office (SFCN) of the National Park Service began monthly aerial surveys of colonial waterbirds within Biscayne National Park, the first systematic monitoring of waterbirds in this Park (Muxo et al. 2015). In this investigation, I use ARIMA models to investigate the seasonality of the breeding activity seen in the park.

# Methods
Beginning in 2009, the SFCN began monthly aerial surveys of known bird colonies (Muxo et al. 2015). An additional yearly survey of the entire park is also conducted to look for newly established colonies. Surveys are accomplished by helicopter, which circles offshore of the colony island at an elevation of 150 feet. A biologist uses a Nikon D300s SLR camera with a Nikon AF-S 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 VR zoom lens to take oblique aerial photographs of each colony. The biologist takes pictures continuously in order to later create a mosaic of overlapping pictures that cover the entire breeding colony. A second observer accompanies the biologist to assist with data collection.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The photos are then processed in Adobe Photoshop elements 15. Photos are visually scanned for identifiable active nests. Active nests are classified for breeding status and include nests with eggs, chicks, adult birds, and those that are unoccupied but appear well-maintained (see Muxo et al. 2015 for more details). Photos are printed and physically examined to ensure nests are not double-counted in overlapping photos from the same survey. Individual nests are not tracked through time.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Only survey data from 2010-2018 were used for analyses because these years represent complete annual surveys. Thirteen months (January, May, August, and October 2012, January, October, and November 2013, October and November 2014, April and May 2016, May 2017, and March 2018) were not surveyed due to logistical constraints (i.e. budget, helicopter availability, weather). To fill in these gaps, the nest count in the month preceding and following the gap were averaged.
